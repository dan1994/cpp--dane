DanE (Dan Encoder) is a `C++` training exercise with the purpose of writing a **generic** text encoder/decoder, with a specific implemnentation for Huffman coding.

The goal of this exercise is to learn about:

- Defining the requirements for a software system
- Designing using UML methodology and tools
- Writing optimal `C++` including correct use of `C++11`, `C++14` and `C++17` features as well as the standard library
- Designing and writing tests using the `gtest` framework
- Using `scons` as a build infrastructure
- Using continuous integration
- Code coverage, static checks, code documentation (`doxygen`), etc.

## Documentation

The `docs/` folder contains the requirements for the project in a markdown format as well as a design written using `plantuml` which is a language that allows textual representation of class diagrams and more (I chose it since the textual format allows to manage changes to the design using `git`).
